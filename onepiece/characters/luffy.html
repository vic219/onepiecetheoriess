            <h2>Monkey D. Luffy</h2>

            <p>
                Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as “Straw Hat Luffy,” is the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
                He seeks the legendary treasure of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, aiming to become the next Pirate King 
                and fulfill a deeper dream known only to his closest companions. To Luffy, being Pirate King means having 
                the most freedom in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary Army leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the 
                Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, making him a member of the mysterious Clan of D. Raised under Garp’s influence 
                and the care of Curly Dadan, Luffy grew up alongside Ace and Sabo, to whom he swore unwavering brotherhood. 
                His greatest inspiration, however, is “Red-Haired” Shanks, who accidentally enabled him to eat the Devil 
                Fruit that turned his body into rubber.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout his journey, Luffy has opposed some of the world’s most powerful forces—from the Marines and 
                Seven Warlords to the World Nobles, Cipher Pol, and even the Four Emperors. Despite his youth, he has 
                triumphed over many of these adversaries, famously escaping Impel Down, influencing the outcome of the 
                Summit War, and defeating multiple Warlords and an Emperor.
            </p>

            <p>
                His actions have earned him widespread infamy, numerous allies, and a growing list of enemies. Luffy 
                is recognized as one of the Worst Generation, the reluctant leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and, 
                following his victory over Kaidou in the Raid on Onigashima, an official Emperor of the Sea. His current 
                bounty stands at 3,000,000,000. With the awakening of his Devil Fruit, now revealed to be the Mythical 
                Zoan Human-Human Fruit: Model Nika, many believe Luffy represents the return of Joy Boy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Luffy is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime.
