            <h2>"Black Leg" Sanji</h2>

            <!-- Character bio from One Piece Wiki -->
            <p>
                "Black Leg" Sanji is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born as Vinsmoke Sanji, the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
            </p>
            <p>
                His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, the All Blue, which is where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who is referred to as the "Monster Trio".
            </p>
            <p>
                He first gained a bounty of 77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to 177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted to Dead or Alive (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it), and its value increased to 330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 1,032,000,000.
            </p>
