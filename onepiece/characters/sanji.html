            <h2>"Black Leg" Sanji</h2>

            <p>
                “Black Leg” Sanji is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and a Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. 
                He is the fifth official member of the crew, joining at the end of the Baratie Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born as Vinsmoke Sanji, he is the third son of the Vinsmoke Family of Germa Kingdom. After rejecting his 
                family's cruel ideology, he fled and eventually became the sous chef of the Baratie under Zeff. Sanji 
                finally joined Luffy after being convinced to pursue his dream of finding the legendary All Blue.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sanji is one of the “Monster Trio,” the three strongest fighters of the Straw Hat Pirates. His kicks-based 
                martial arts style, combined with his fiery Diable Jambe, makes him one of the most powerful fighters 
                in the crew.
            </p>

            <p>
                His bounty has evolved dramatically over time—starting at 77,000,000 after Enies Lobby, then rising to 
                177,000,000 after Dressrosa. A later political plot by his father changed his bounty to “Only Alive” and 
                rebranded him as “Vinsmoke Sanji.” After Whole Cake Island, it returned to “Dead or Alive” at 330,000,000. 
                Following the Onigashima Raid, Sanji achieved a new bounty of 1,032,000,000.
            </p>
