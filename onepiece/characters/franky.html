            <h2>"Iron Man" Franky</h2>

            <p>
                "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of 
                the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew’s eighth member and the seventh to officially join 
                at the end of the Post–Enies Lobby Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born as Cutty Flam, he abandoned his birth name at Iceburg’s request to keep his identity hidden. 
                Originally from South Blue, Franky was abandoned at age 10 and eventually reached Water 7, where 
                he joined Tom's Workers. After a tragic accident left his body heavily damaged, he rebuilt 
                himself into a cyborg using scrap metal and technology of his own creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Franky later formed the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters. Though he 
                initially clashed with the Straw Hats during the Water 7 Arc, circumstances forced them into 
                alliance. Ultimately, Franky fulfilled his dream of building a ship to sail around the world—the 
                Thousand Sunny—and joined the Straw Hats to complete that journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                His bounty first rose to 44,000,000 after the Enies Lobby Incident, then to 94,000,000 after 
                Dressrosa. Following the Raid on Onigashima, it increased to 394,000,000.
            </p>
