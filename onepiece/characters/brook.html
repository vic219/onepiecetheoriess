            <h2>"Soul King" Brook</h2>

            <!-- Character Bio -->
            <p>
                "Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, and a Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. 
                He is the ninth member of the crew and officially joined at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once. Over time, 
                he learned to harness its powers more deeply, gaining control over his own soul and the souls of others.
            </p>

            <p>
                Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, Brook died and was resurrected through his Devil Fruit. 
                However, due to the long delay before his soul found his body, he returned as a skeleton, retaining only his afro. 
                He wandered the Florian Triangle for 50 years before meeting Luffy and joining the Straw Hats. 
                His ultimate dream is to reunite with Laboon at Reverse Mountain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Brook’s bounty was initially 33,000,000, later rising to 83,000,000 after Dressrosa. 
                Following the Raid on Onigashima, it was increased dramatically to 383,000,000.
            </p>
