            <h2>"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe</h2>

            <p>
                "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers 
                of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the tenth member of the crew and officially joined during 
                the Wano Country Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a master of Fish-Man Karate. His lifelong dream is to uphold 
                his former captain Fisher Tiger’s will—pursuing equality and peaceful coexistence between humans 
                and fish-men. Once a member of the Sun Pirates, Jinbe later became their second captain, and 
                eventually a Warlord of the Sea, a title he later renounced.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jinbe befriended Luffy before the Summit War of Marineford and formally allied with the Straw 
                Hats during the conflict on Fish-Man Island. Though Luffy invited him to join the crew, Jinbe 
                postponed acceptance until he could safely sever ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                After staying behind to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom’s rage, Jinbe finally reunited with 
                the Straw Hats in Wano, officially becoming part of the crew. His bounty has risen multiple times, 
                now reaching 1,100,000,000 following the Onigashima Raid.
            </p>
