            <h2>Nico Robin</h2>

            <!-- Character bio from One Piece Wiki -->
            <p>
                Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the "Light of the Revolution," is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
            </p>
            <p>
                She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday," serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
            </p>
            <p>
                She gained a bounty of 79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to 80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to 130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to 930,000,000.
            </p>
