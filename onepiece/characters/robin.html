            <h2>Nico Robin</h2>

            <p>
                Nico Robin, known as the “Devil Child” and the “Light of the Revolution,” is the archaeologist 
                of the Straw Hat Pirates and a Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh 
                member of the crew and officially joined at the end of the Arabasta Arc. Robin temporarily left 
                during Water 7 but returned during the Enies Lobby Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born to archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia. She ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, 
                granting her the ability to sprout her body parts on any surface. As the sole survivor of Ohara, she is 
                one of only two people capable of reading Poneglyphs—a forbidden and dangerous skill that the World 
                Government relentlessly seeks to erase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before joining the Straw Hats, Robin worked as “Miss All Sunday,” the vice president of Baroque Works 
                under Crocodile. Initially a secondary antagonist, she later became a core member of the crew. Her 
                dream is to uncover the Rio Poneglyph and reveal the true history of the Void Century.
            </p>

            <p>
                Robin’s first bounty of 79,000,000 was issued when she was only 8 after Ohara’s destruction. It rose to 
                80,000,000 after Enies Lobby, then to 130,000,000 after Dressrosa, and to 930,000,000 after the Raid 
                on Onigashima.
            </p>
