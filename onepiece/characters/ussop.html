            <h2>"God" Usopp</h2>

            <p>
                “God” Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and a Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. 
                He is the fourth member of the crew and officially joined at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Though 
                he left temporarily during Water 7, he rejoined after the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usopp is the son of Yasopp of the Red-Haired Pirates and the late Banchina. Raised in Syrup Village, 
                he formed the Usopp Pirates and became close friends with Kaya. After helping defeat Kuro and the Black 
                Cat Pirates, Usopp joined Luffy’s crew, pursuing his dream of becoming a brave warrior of the sea.
            </p>

            <p>
                His first bounty, 30,000,000, was issued under his Sogeking persona after Enies Lobby. After Dressrosa, 
                he received a new bounty of 200,000,000 under his real name. Following the Raid on Onigashima, Usopp’s 
                bounty increased to 500,000,000.
            </p>
