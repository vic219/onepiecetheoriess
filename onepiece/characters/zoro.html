            <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>

            <p>
                Roronoa Zoro, also known as “Pirate Hunter” Zoro, is the swordsman and main combatant of the Straw Hat 
                Pirates, as well as a Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the second member of the crew 
                and the first to join Luffy, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc. Zoro is widely recognized as Luffy’s 
                right-hand man.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born in the East Blue, Zoro was raised in Shimotsuki Village, where he trained in swordsmanship and 
                created his unique Three Sword Style. He is a descendant of the Shimotsuki Family of Wano and of the 
                legendary samurai Shimotsuki Ryuma. As one of the “Monster Trio” alongside Luffy and Sanji, Zoro is 
                among the crew’s strongest fighters. His dream is to become the world’s greatest swordsman, fulfilling 
                a promise to his late childhood friend Kuina.
            </p>

            <p>
                Zoro’s strength and reputation led to him being counted among the “Super Rookies” upon reaching Sabaody 
                Archipelago with a bounty over 100,000,000. Together with the other Supernovas and Blackbeard, he is also 
                part of the “Worst Generation.”
            </p>

            <p>
                His bounty history reflects his growth: 60,000,000 after Arabasta, 120,000,000 after Enies Lobby, 
                320,000,000 after Dressrosa, and finally 1,111,000,000 following the Raid on Onigashima.
            </p>
