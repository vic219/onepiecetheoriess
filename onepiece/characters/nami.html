            <h2>Nami</h2>

            <p>
                “Cat Burglar” Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and a Senior Officer of the 
                Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the third crew member and officially joined during the Orange 
                Town Arc. Orphaned young, she was taken in alongside Nojiko by Bell-mère, forming a loving 
                adoptive family.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before joining the Straw Hats, Nami was forced into the Arlong Pirates. She initially joined 
                the Straw Hats to steal money to free her village from Arlong’s control, acting as a temporary 
                antagonist in the Baratie Arc. After Luffy defeated Arlong, she joined the crew for real. 
                Her dream is to draw a complete map of the entire world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nami’s first bounty was 16,000,000 after Enies Lobby. It rose to 66,000,000 after Dressrosa 
                and later to 366,000,000 after the events of Onigashima.
            </p>
