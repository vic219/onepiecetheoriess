            <!-- THEORY 1 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece is the Rio Poneglyph</h2>
                <p>
                    According to this theory, the “One Piece” isn’t a physical treasure chest at all but rather the text inscribed upon the mythical Rio Poneglyph itself. Across the Grand Line, the four Road Poneglyphs each bear fragments of coordinates leading to Laugh Tale, and the Rio Poneglyph is said to contain the true history of the Void Century. The theory proposes that once all Road Poneglyphs are united, their combined revelation will unveil the Rio’s location—and when read in full, its inscriptions comprise the One Piece.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 2 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece is a Devil Fruit</h2>
                <p>
                    A compelling theory within the One Piece fandom posits that the legendary treasure, the One Piece, is a unique and immensely powerful Devil Fruit. Vegapunk’s revelation in Chapter 1069 supports this, suggesting Devil Fruits manifest humanity’s desires and dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the One Piece could be a “Sea-Sea Fruit,” granting the ability to control the ocean itself—overcoming the Devil Fruit users’ greatest weakness: seawater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interpretation connects the treasure to the Void Century and its lost technology, implying the One Piece may embody accumulated knowledge or aspirations from that ancient era.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 3 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece Is Extremely Dangerous</h2>
                <p>
                    This theory suggests the One Piece is a powerful force capable of reshaping the world. It may be tied to the Ancient Weapons—Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus—or to advanced forgotten technology like the Mother Flame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the One Piece reveals the complete truth of the Void Century, it could destabilize the entire world order and threaten the World Government’s legitimacy.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 4 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece Is Not a Treasure</h2>
                <p>
                    A popular theory suggests the One Piece isn’t a physical reward but the complete history of the Void Century or the truth behind the Ancient Kingdom. Its value would then lie in knowledge, not material wealth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 5 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Luffy’s Straw Hat Is One Piece</h2>
                <p>
                    Some theorists argue the Straw Hat itself is the One Piece. Passed from Roger to Shanks to Luffy—and possibly from Joy Boy before them—it symbolizes freedom, leadership, and the dawn of a new era.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 6 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Gol D. Roger Wasn’t the First Pirate King</h2>
                <p>
                    This theory proposes that powerful figures like Rocks D. Xebec or even Joy Boy may have ruled the seas long before Roger, shaping the world in ways comparable to or greater than the Pirate King.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 7 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Inherited Will Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    Inherited Will suggests the dreams of individuals live on through others. Roger’s will, passed through Shanks to Luffy, reflects this theme—reinforcing the idea that wills transcend lifetimes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 8 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Luffy Is Joy Boy</h2>
                <p>
                    After Luffy’s Gear 5 awakening, fans believe he is Joy Boy’s successor—or even reincarnation—especially with his Nika-based Devil Fruit and the return of the “Drums of Liberation.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 9 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Joy Boy Gave Imu the Ancient Weapon Uranus</h2>
                <p>
                    This theory implies Joy Boy entrusted Uranus to Imu, who later betrayed him. This betrayal could explain the suppression of knowledge from the Void Century.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 10 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Imu Is Joy Boy</h2>
                <p>
                    A bold idea suggests Imu is the corrupted reincarnation of Joy Boy, now ruling in secrecy at the top of the World Government.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 11 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Blackbeard Has Three Souls</h2>
                <p>
                    This theory comes from Blackbeard wielding multiple Devil Fruits and from his three-skull Jolly Roger. Some believe he contains three souls or entities inside him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 12 -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Raftel Is Underwater</h2>
                <p>
                    This theory argues the true Laugh Tale lies underwater, possibly beneath Reverse Mountain or deep within the Calm Belt—accessible only through unique abilities or knowledge.
                </p>
