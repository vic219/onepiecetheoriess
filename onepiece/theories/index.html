            <!-- Each theory in its own box -->

            <!-- THEORY 1: Rio Poneglyph -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <!-- Highlighted title -->
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece is the Rio Poneglyph</h2>
                <p>
                    According to this theory, the “One Piece” isn’t a physical treasure chest at all but rather the text inscribed upon the mythical Rio Poneglyph itself. Across the Grand Line, the four Road Poneglyphs each bear fragments of coordinates leading to Laugh Tale, and the Rio Poneglyph is said to contain the true history of the Void Century. The theory proposes that once all Road Poneglyphs are united, their combined revelation will unveil the Rio’s location—and when read in full, its inscriptions comprise the One Piece.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 2: One Piece is a Devil Fruit -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece is a Devil Fruit</h2>
                <p>
                    A compelling theory within the One Piece fandom posits that the legendary treasure, the One Piece, is not merely a tangible object but rather a unique and immensely powerful Devil Fruit. This hypothesis gains traction when considering Dr. Vegapunk's revelation in Chapter 1069, where he theorizes that Devil Fruits are manifestations of human desires and dreams, representing possible evolutionary paths that individuals have yearned for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the One Piece is indeed a Devil Fruit, it would likely be unparalleled in its capabilities, potentially granting its user dominion over the seas themselves. Such a power aligns with the notion of the "Sea-Sea Fruit," a hypothetical Devil Fruit that would allow its consumer to control the ocean, effectively overcoming the primary weakness that plagues all Devil Fruit users: their inability to swim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theory also intertwines with the enigmatic Void Century and the ancient civilization that existed before the World Government's rise. The One Piece, as a Devil Fruit, could embody the culmination of that lost era's knowledge and aspirations, offering a means to challenge the world's current power structures and bring about a new era of freedom and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this remains speculative, the idea that the One Piece is a Devil Fruit encapsulates the series' recurring themes of inherited will, the pursuit of dreams, and the transformative power of desire. It suggests that the ultimate treasure is not just a physical reward but a symbol of humanity's boundless potential and the enduring quest for liberation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 3: Extremely Dangerous -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece Is Extremely Dangerous</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that the One Piece is "extremely dangerous" suggests that it is not merely a treasure but a powerful force capable of reshaping the world. This perspective arises from various elements within the series that hint at the One Piece's potential to disrupt the existing world order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One compelling aspect is the connection between the One Piece and the Ancient Weapons—Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus. These weapons possess immense destructive capabilities, and some theories posit that the One Piece could be one of these weapons or a means to activate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the concept of ancient energy and advanced technology from the Void Century plays into this theory. The Ancient Kingdom, known for its superior science, created technologies that even the brilliant Dr. Vegapunk struggles to comprehend. The existence of the Mother Flame, a source of undying energy capable of leveling countries, exemplifies the potential dangers of such technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the idea that the One Piece could be a comprehensive historical record revealing the true history of the world adds another layer of danger. If the One Piece exposes the secrets of the Void Century and the origins of the World Government, it could incite global upheaval and challenge the legitimacy of the current ruling powers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 4: Not a Treasure -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">One Piece Is Not a Treasure</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that the One Piece is not a traditional treasure posits that its true value lies not in material wealth but in the profound truths and historical revelations it holds. This perspective suggests that the One Piece is a metaphorical treasure—perhaps the complete history of the Void Century, the secrets of the Ancient Kingdom, or the true nature of the World Government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theory is supported by several elements within the series. For instance, the existence of the Poneglyphs and the scholars of Ohara indicates that there is a hidden history that the World Government seeks to suppress. The idea that the One Piece could be a comprehensive historical record aligns with the notion that knowledge itself is the ultimate treasure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the reactions of characters who have learned parts of the world's true history suggest that this knowledge is both dangerous and transformative. The World Government's efforts to prevent the discovery of the Void Century's secrets imply that the One Piece's value lies in its potential to upend the current world order.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 5: Straw Hat Is One Piece -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Luffy’s Straw Hat Is One Piece</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Luffy’s Straw Hat is the One Piece posits that the hat is not merely a symbol but the actual treasure sought by pirates for generations. This perspective stems from the hat's deep-rooted history and symbolic significance within the series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, the straw hat has been passed down from Gol D. Roger to Shanks, and then to Luffy, indicating its importance across generations of influential pirates. Some fans speculate that the hat may have originally belonged to Joy Boy, a pivotal figure from the Void Century, further enhancing its significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symbolically, the straw hat represents more than just a piece of clothing. It embodies ideals such as freedom, dreams, and the dawn of a new era. The hat's simplicity and humility, combined with its association with powerful figures, suggest it could be a metaphorical crown, signifying rightful leadership or the ushering in of significant change.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 6: Roger Wasn’t First -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Gol D. Roger Wasn’t the First Pirate King</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Gol D. Roger wasn't the first Pirate King suggests that others may have held similar titles or influence before him. While Roger is officially recognized as the first to conquer the Grand Line and reach Laugh Tale, earning him the title "Pirate King," the existence of powerful figures like Rocks D. Xebec and Joy Boy hints at predecessors with comparable ambitions and impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rocks D. Xebec, who led the formidable Rocks Pirates decades before Roger's era, sought to dominate the world and had a crew comprising future legends like Whitebeard, Big Mom, and Kaido. His defeat required the combined efforts of Roger and Marine hero Garp, indicating his significant threat to the world order.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 7: Inherited Will -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Inherited Will Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    The Inherited Will theory in One Piece posits that the dreams, ambitions, and ideals of individuals transcend their lifetimes, living on through others who share similar aspirations. This concept is a cornerstone of the series, emphasizing that while people may die, their will endures as long as someone carries it forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A prominent example is the relationship between Gol D. Roger and Monkey D. Luffy. Roger, the former Pirate King, discovered the world's secrets but was "too early" to act upon them. His will, symbolized by the straw hat, was passed to Shanks and then to Luffy, who now embodies Roger's spirit and determination.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 8: Luffy is Joy Boy -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Luffy Is Joy Boy</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Luffy is Joy Boy has evolved from speculation to near-confirmation within the One Piece narrative, particularly following pivotal events in the Wano arc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the climax of Luffy's battle against Kaido, he undergoes a profound transformation after being defeated. This awakening reveals that his Devil Fruit, long believed to be the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit, is actually the Mythical Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 9: Joy Boy Gave Imu Uranus -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Joy Boy Gave Imu the Ancient Weapon Uranus</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Joy Boy gave Imu the Ancient Weapon Uranus suggests a profound betrayal that reshaped the world of One Piece. According to this perspective, Joy Boy, a central figure from the Void Century, may have entrusted Uranus to Imu, who was either a close ally or a member of Joy Boy's inner circle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further supporting this theory is the notion that Joy Boy intended for the Ancient Weapons to be inherited by future generations. However, Imu's betrayal disrupted this plan, leading to the suppression of knowledge about Uranus.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 10: Imu is Joy Boy -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Imu Is Joy Boy</h2>
                <p>
                    One striking theory posits that Imu is none other than the original Joy Boy, his spirit reborn as the shadowy ruler of the World Government. According to this view, Joy Boy survived the Void Century but grew disillusioned and, corrupted by the power of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, seized control of Mary Geoise under a new identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fans note that Imu can sense the “Drums of Liberation” from afar—Joy Boy’s signature Supreme King Haki—hinting at a shared consciousness.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 11: Blackbeard Has Three Souls -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Blackbeard Has Three Souls</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Blackbeard possesses three souls is a compelling fan interpretation within the One Piece universe. This concept arises from his unique ability to wield multiple Devil Fruits, a feat considered impossible for any other character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supporting this theory, fans point to various hints in the series. For instance, Blackbeard's Jolly Roger features three skulls, which may symbolize multiple entities within him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEORY 12: Raftel is Underwater -->
            <div class="moreboxes">
                <h2 class="highlight">Raftel Is Underwater</h2>
                <p>
                    The theory that Raftel (also known as Laugh Tale) is located underwater posits that the island is hidden beneath the sea, possibly under Reverse Mountain or within the Calm Belt. This theory suggests that the island's submersion is due to a cataclysmic event during the Void Century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accessing Raftel would require navigating treacherous underwater currents, possibly through the Calm Belt, and the ability to "hear the voice of all things," a rare skill possessed by characters like Luffy and Gol D. Roger.
