# Popular One Piece Theories

Thank you for checking out **Popular One Piece Theories**, a fan-made CS50 web project that brings together the wildest, most intriguing theories about Eiichiro Oda’s epic series. Drawing inspiration from the slick, dynamic layout of a Formula 1-themed site, this project adapts that structure and styling to showcase fan speculation, character deep-dives, and story‐arc analyses in an immersive, responsive design. Whether you’re here to revisit long–standing debates like “Is Luffy the next Pirate King?” or to explore fresh ideas about the Void Century, this site offers a clear, navigable home for all your One Piece curiosities.
