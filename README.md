Popular One Piece Theories

Popular One Piece Theories is a fully static website created as a CS50 project. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. The site organizes and showcases a collection of popular fan theories from the world of One Piece, along with short introductions to members of the Straw Hat Pirates.

The design takes inspiration from Formula 1 news portals, which use a fast, modular, image-focused layout. This project adapts that same structure to anime content, giving One Piece fans a clean, visually appealing way to explore characters and theories.

No backend, frameworks, or databases were used. Everything is hand-coded and runs entirely in the browser.
